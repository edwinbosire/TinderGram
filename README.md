###Contributors
- Just me at the moment.

###Acknowledgment
I better write this before I became famous and forget to give credits.
A lot of the work here is based off the following frameworks, I've just written the glue to stick them together

- [Koloda](https://github.com/Yalantis/Koloda)
- [Pop](https://github.com/facebook/pop) by facebook

And of course stack overflow whenever I was too lazy to read up on a readily available, well documented iOS feature.
